For this project we were tasked with helping a marketing company make their website compliant with accessibility standards and to make it optimized with search engines. 

THe project was complete when the following acceptance criteria was met:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

In addition, we also needed the following criteria to be met:

Technical Acceptance Criteria:
Application's links all function correctly.
Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
Application's CSS file is properly commented.

Deployment Criteria:
Application deployed at live URL.
Application loads with no errors.
Application GitHub URL submitted.
GitHub repository that contains application code.

Application Quality:
It needs to resemble the challenge screenshots at a minimum of 90%

Repository Quality: 
Repository has a unique name.
Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.
Repository contains a quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

I did add alt descriptions for the images; however, for the background image I had to use an aria-label- the alt description would not work. I also had some trouble combining the CSS selectors. I tried quite a few different ways, but then I followed what I found on the W3 website. I added HTML semantics to the index because the file had non-describitive elements.
